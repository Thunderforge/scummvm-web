Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:

In [_Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger_](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Nancy_Drew:_Stay_Tuned_for_Danger), a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. 

[_Nancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion_](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Nancy_Drew:_Message_in_a_Haunted_Mansion) has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.

In [_Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower_](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Nancy_Drew:_Treasure_in_the_Royal_Tower) a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.

And if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in [_Nancy Drew: The Final Scene_](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Nancy_Drew:_The_Final_Scene), you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.

The games are available for purchase through [HeR Interactive’s website](https://www.herinteractive.com/shop-games/all-games/) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=nancy+drew) (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a [daily development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily). As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
