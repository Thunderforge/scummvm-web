Following our announcement about affiliation with ZOOM-Platform, we would like to give a note that they have just started to offer the Macintosh versions of  [*Syberia 1*](https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/syberia-1?affiliate=c049516c-9c4c-42d6-8649-92ed870e8b53) and [*Syberia 2*](https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/syberia-2?affiliate=c049516c-9c4c-42d6-8649-92ed870e8b53) bundled with ScummVM.

This is important because ScummVM currently supports only the Macintosh versions of these games. These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.
