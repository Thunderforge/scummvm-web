Dr. Bacterio has a new invention, and it's your job to test it. Work your way through classic Hollywood films while somehow finding the time to save the real world from the mummy.

Whether you have the Spanish _Mortadelo y Filemón: Aventura de Cine Edición especial_ or the German _Clever & Smart: A Movie Adventure_ (check out [the demo here](https://scummvm.org/demos/)), the [daily build](https://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) will transport you to the world of Film Noir in no time. The ScummVM Team would be grateful for any feedback you could share on your journey to meet Billy the Kid or Freddy Krueger.

Just a quick reminder that the Steam version has English subtitles for players who don't speak Spanish or German.

Before you start your test run, please read through our [testing guidelines](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing) and take some [screenshots](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) along the way.

Now don't let the Super wait!
