Do you want to expose the deepest secrets of the Tremendous CorporationÂ® and save the games industry? Are you interested in helping a young man who's out of order in an alien future? Or will you join the story of Nathan, who wants to get a second chance in life?

If you answered "yes", then get ready, as we are happy to announce full support for all games based on the [SLUDGE](https://opensludge.github.io/) engine. The original work began back in 2017, by one of our GSoC students, Simei Yin. Now, after many years of development, the following games are available for public testing:
* _Above The Waves_
* _Cubert Badbone, P.I._
* _Frasse And The Peas Of Kejick_
* _The Game That Takes Place On a Cruise Ship_
* _The Interview_
* _Lepton's Quest_
* _Life Flashes By_
* _Mandy Christmas Adventure_
* _Nathan's Second Chance_
* _Out of Order_
* _Robin's Rescue_
* _The Secret of Tremendous Corporation_

Essentially, this is the list of all the SLUDGE-based games we know of.

So download your free copies of the games from [our game downloads page](https://www.scummvm.org/games/) and use a daily [development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) to start playing. If you encounter any issues, please submit bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).

Finally, please [contact us](https://www.scummvm.org/contact/) if you are aware of other games using SLUDGE, variant releases, or releases that are not getting detected properly.
