We are pleased to announce an affiliate partnership with [ZOOM-Platform](https://www.zoom-platform.com/?affiliate=c049516c-9c4c-42d6-8649-92ed870e8b53), a supplier of DRM-free games. If you use a link from this website (or from our Wiki), the ScummVM project will receive a small amount of money to be used for web hosting and other expenses.

Any purchases from ZOOM-Platform qualify, but we especially encourage you to check out games supported by ScummVM, such as the *Syberia 1, 2*, *Galador*,  [Obsidian](https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/obsidian?affiliate=c049516c-9c4c-42d6-8649-92ed870e8b53) as well as 18 titles from the [*Living Books* series](https://www.zoom-platform.com/search/any/wanderful-interactive-storybooks/any/any/any/any/any/any?affiliate=c049516c-9c4c-42d6-8649-92ed870e8b53). In total, we counted 25 games supported by ScummVM, and this list is growing.

We will keep an up-to-date list of the games available from this platform on [our Wiki](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Where_to_get_the_games) and have added an affiliate link on the sidebar here.
