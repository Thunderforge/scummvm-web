The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. 

If you want to help by testing this version, just follow [this Testflight link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/h9OfDrEQ) and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our [documentation portal](https://docs.scummvm.org/en/latest/other_platforms/ios.html).

We truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use [our bugtracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org), e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4cDsMNtcpG). Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.
