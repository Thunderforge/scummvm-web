After many years of development, games made with [World Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Builder) are ready for testing. The World Builder creation system was released for the original Macintosh and was extremely popular among developers. As such, we're announcing that over __160__ games built on the engine are ready for public testing in ScummVM.
Notable games made with World Builder include:
* _Ray's Maze_. The game follows Frank Farley, a part-time adventurer, who finds himself in a Maze full of dangerous monsters and deadly traps. The objective of the game is to solve puzzles and escape the maze.
* _Radical Castle_. You are given the role of a squire, who must bring back the stolen "Oracle" to the King to escape a fatal punishment.
* _Enchanced Scepters_. The first game created using World Builder, and one of the few commercial games made with it. The player must find fire, earth, air, and water scepters and bring them back to the castle.


Most games made with WAGE are either freeware or shareware, and for your convenience we've collected all titles with these types into one big downloadable archive. So grab it from our [game downloads page](https://www.scummvm.org/games/), get yourself a daily [development build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily), and start your journey. As always, if you happen to have any issues, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/). Lastly, [contact us](https://www.scummvm.org/contact/) if you have some other unrecognised games or a new demo.
